<div class="collapsible-heading" role="button" aria-expanded="false" tabindex="0">What is a professional portfolio?</div>
<div class="collapsible-area">
<p>A professional portfolio is a digital collection of artifacts that showcase your skills, accomplishments, and learning. In this course, your portfolio focuses on providing evidence that reflects your growth and professional competencies as you progress. Over time, your portfolio will become a powerful resource site that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlights your expertise and achievements through course-based work.</li>
<li>Demonstrates your ability to apply AI concepts in real-world scenarios.</li>
<li>Positions you as a change leader who provides valuable insights, solutions, and resources to others.</li>
</ul>
<p>This portfolio is not just about showcasing what you have done; it is about demonstrating the value you bring and can continue to bring as a professional. Think of your portfolio as a resource site—a place where your target audience can find examples, ideas, and solutions that you have developed. It should reflect your potential to lead change and make an impact in your field.</p>
<p>While this portfolio emphasizes artifacts developed during your coursework, you may also have other professional artifacts from outside this program that showcase your experience. These can be included in a different portfolio or, if added to this one, will not count as any of the required artifacts for this class.</p>
<p>Remember: as you build your portfolio, you’re not just creating a personal archive; you’re crafting a tool that can inspire and guide others in your field.</p>

<div class="collapsible">
<div class="collapsible-heading" role="button" aria-expanded="false" tabindex="0">What are portfolio artifacts?</div>
<div class="collapsible-area">
<p>An artifact is something you create during your coursework that shows what you have learned or achieved. Think of it as a piece of evidence that represents your skills, knowledge, or abilities. For example, it could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A report or project you completed.</li>
<li>A presentation you prepared.</li>
<li>A diagram or chart you designed to explain something.</li>
<li>A video you recorded to demonstrate a skill.</li>
</ul>
<p>Artifacts must include tangible deliverables, such as documents, screenshots, articles, code files, reports, visualizations, or presentations. A description alone is not sufficient.</p>
<p>Think of your artifact as a finished piece of work that could be shown to a potential employer or collaborator.</p>
<p><b>Good:</b> A completed dashboard with screenshots and a detailed write-up of its creation process.</p>
<p><b>Not good: </b>A paragraph describing how you made a dashboard, but without any evidence.</p>
<p><b>Good:</b> A quick-reference guide that can be downloaded and information about how to use the guide.</p>
<p><b>Not good: </b>Information about a project where you created a quick-reference guide, but no guide is available.</p>
<p>When selecting your artifacts, ask these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Would this artifact help someone understand my skills and approach if they were hiring me?</li>
<li>Would it demonstrate my ability to tackle real-world problems?"</li>
<li>Would it be useful?</li>
<li>Would it be interesting and informative?</li>
</ul>

</div>
</div>
<div class="collapsible">
<div class="collapsible-heading" role="button" aria-expanded="false" tabindex="0">What information must be included with each artifact?</div>
<div class="collapsible-area">
<p>In your portfolio, an artifact is like "proof" of what you can do. It should be connected to what you learned in class and show how you applied it. Each artifact needs to be accompanied by certain informational elements, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Title</b>: What is it? (e.g., "Marketing Plan for Small Business")</li>
<li><b>Objective</b>: Why did you create it? (e.g., "To learn how to create a marketing plan.")</li>
<li><b>Process</b>: How did you make it? (e.g., "I researched market trends, interviewed experts, and used a marketing template.")</li>
<li><b>Tools</b>: What did you use? (e.g., "Microsoft PowerPoint, Excel, and Canva.")</li>
<li><b>Value Proposition</b>: Why is it important? (e.g., "It shows my ability to analyze market needs and create effective strategies.")</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also think of an artifact like showing your work in math class. It’s not just about the final answer but how you got there. The artifact information helps others see what you did and how you can use those skills in the future.</p>
<p><b>The portfolio is not just for you; it’s also a resource for others.</b> When someone looks at your portfolio, they should be able to learn from your experiences and understand how they might approach similar tasks. By sharing your artifacts, you are helping others see what you’ve learned and how it can be applied in real-world situations. Your portfolio is a way to teach and inspire others while demonstrating your own growth and achievements.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="collapsible">
<div class="collapsible-heading" role="button" aria-expanded="false" tabindex="0">Reflection is also required!</div>
<div class="collapsible-area">
<p>As you build your professional portfolio, the reflection piece serves as an essential element that goes beyond simply showcasing your work. Here’s why it is required and how it adds value to your learning and growth:</p>
<p><b>1. Reflection Helps You Deepen Your Understanding</b></p>
<p>When you take the time to reflect on an artifact, you’re not just describing what you created—you’re analyzing why it matters. Reflection encourages you to think critically about:</p>
<ul>
<li>The process you used to complete the artifact.</li>
<li>The decisions you made along the way.</li>
<li>What you learned about the subject and about yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>This level of introspection helps solidify your understanding and ensures that you can articulate your skills and experiences effectively to others.</p>
<p><b>2. Reflection Shows Your Growth</b></p>
<p>Each artifact you create is a step in your learning journey. The reflection allows you to document:</p>
<ul>
<li>How your skills have developed over time.</li>
<li>What challenges you overcame and how.</li>
<li>How feedback and revisions improved the final product.</li>
</ul>
<p>By looking back on your reflections, you can see clear evidence of your progress and growth as a professional.</p>
<p><b>3. Reflection Demonstrates the Value of Your Work</b></p>
<p>Your portfolio is not just about showing what you’ve done—it’s about demonstrating the value you bring to the field. The reflection helps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect your work to your personal value proposition.</li>
<li>Explain how your artifact meets the needs of a specific audience.</li>
<li>Highlight why the artifact is relevant and impactful.</li>
</ul>
<p>This ability to articulate the value of your work is a critical skill for job interviews, presentations, and leadership roles.</p>
<p><b>4. Reflection Encourages Lifelong Learning</b></p>
<p>In fields like AI and machine learning, the ability to learn from experience and adapt is crucial. Reflection helps you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify areas where you can improve.</li>
<li>Recognize patterns in your approach to problem-solving.</li>
<li>Build the habit of evaluating your work, which is essential for continuous improvement.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What to Include in Your Reflection</b></p>
<p>For each artifact addition, submit reflections to the professor through the designated text area in Brightspace.</p>
<p>Reflections should include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customization for the Audience:</b> How did you tailor the artifact to meet the needs of its intended audience?</li>
<li><b>Lessons Learned:</b> What did you learn during the creation process?</li>
<li><b>Feedback and Revisions:</b> What feedback did you receive, and how did you incorporate it?</li>
</ul>
<p>These elements ensure that your reflection is thoughtful, comprehensive, and meaningful.</p>
